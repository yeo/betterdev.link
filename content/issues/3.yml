    title: "Why your encrypted database is not secure"
    description: "Databases such as MySQL and MongoDB support encryption, either storage encryption at rest or network traffic encryption with TLS. Amazon RDS makes it much more easier by simply toggling an option with RDS. However, is it really that secure? This is a good read to improve knowledge on database encryption generally."

    title: "Running 10 Million PostgreSQL Indexes In Production (And Counting) (2016)"
    description: "Database 101 tells us that we need to use index to speed the query to avoid full table scan over all our data. However, we should not overuse them because it will affect INSERT performance and requires more memory. Hence, we need to be balance on what to index and how. In this post, Heap analytic writes about how they manage to speed up query with over 10 million indexes. It's a good read in database engineering."

    description: "Creating and running an on-call rotation is the very first step in building truly reliable infrastructure at any scale, but it’s far from the last. As a company grows and scales, the systems that it builds and runs grows in complexity and require more sophisticated on-call practices. While there is no universal approach, there are industry best practices for setting up on-call and incident response at any and every size."

    title: "Scaling your API with rate limiters"
    description: "An API is usually used in a stateless manner, so it's more difficult to protect from rate limiting. In a normal web app, we will have user session and a CSRF token check before it's executed. With an API, it is a bit different, a client can misbehave and send lots of unwanted requests, for instance. In this post, Stripe shares how they do their API rate limiting."

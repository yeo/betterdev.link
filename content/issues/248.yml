      Curious exactly what happens when you run a program on your computer? Read this article to learn how multiprocessing works, what system calls really are, how computers manage memory with hardware interrupts, and how Linux loads executables.

    description: |
      I want to provide some tips from my experience implementing a paper. I'm going to cover implementing a dramatically scaled-down version of [Llama](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.13971.pdf) for training [TinyShakespeare](https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn/blob/master/data/tinyshakespeare/input.txt). This post is heavily inspired by Karpathy's Makemore series, which I highly recommend.

      Even when using Multi-AZ on RDS, there is still a chance of downtime where the DNS switch to the standby in other AZ and our app need to switch together. There is a brief moment the app is still connecting to the old primary instance. In this, Instacart shared how they achieved that.

      Dropbox for sure store tons of data. In 2018, they adopt high-density SMR (shingled magnetic recording) technology for storage drives. SMR technology has reduced the power requirements of storage servers, lowered the cost of each exabyte, and enabled more efficient server rack designs. Today, we will learn about all of that.

    description: |
      Distributed systems are behind many services that we use every day. A significant challenge of said systems is to understand and manage the order of events across these independent machines. How can we know which event happened before another? What caused what?”

    title: "Resilient LL Parsing Tutorial"
    description: |
      In this tutorial, I will explain a particular approach to parsing, which gracefully handles syntax errors and is thus suitable for language servers, which, by their nature, have to handle incomplete and invalid code. Explaining the problem and the solution requires somewhat less than a trivial worked example, and I want to share a couple of tricks not directly related to resilience, so the tutorial builds a full, self-contained parser, instead of explaining abstractly just the resilience.

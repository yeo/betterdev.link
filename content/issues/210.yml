  Hi all,

  This week we are light on deep technical content but more on a high level of thing. Some fun stuff about IP address and leap seconds. I like them. I hope you like this issue as much as I do. If so, consider forward this to anyone you think might found this useful.

  Have a great week ahead everyone.

      The Internet was not designed with security in mind. A number of recent protocols such as Encrypted DNS and HTTPS encrypt critical parts of the web architecture, which can otherwise be exploited by eavesdroppers to infer users’ data. But encryption may not necessarily guarantee privacy, especially when it comes to metadata.

      Leap seconds are controversial things. Since the Earth does not rotate at a steady rate, over time the Earth could get ahead or behind “atomic time”. Whatever solution you propose for this, someone is going to be unhappy.

      When you attach event handle to every key stroke, it obviously has a performance since some code has to run for every key stroke. A few approach such as delay, batch, or debounce essentially group multiple events into one to process. But these solutions force a hard code approach where it defined how much delay/batch on all devices/users regardless typing speed or CPU power. In this we will use `requestIdleCallback` to adapt to the responsiveness of each device/user.

      Index-only scan are the query where Postgres only touch the index, without having to fetch the row on hard drive at all. But Postgres, being generic to everyone's workload didn't pickup index-only scan in this case because of this quicrk: "functions and operators can prevent index-only scans"

    description: "You know how when we want to define relation between object we use thing like Parent, Node or even hash maps. And then we have to define their relationship by parsing some file/array. Virgo allow you to define them in this syntax: `a -> b, c, d -> e <- f, g`. Probably not much real life use but it's cool to see how to write a parser for this kind of graph."

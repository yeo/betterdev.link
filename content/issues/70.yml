    description: |
      Nix can generate Docker images, however the typical approach to layering with Nix is to generate one fat image with all of the dependencies. This fat image offers no sharing, is slow to build, upload, and download.
      In this post I talk about using Nix to automatically create multi-layered Docker images, allowing a high amount of caching between image.

      Using PgBouncer for connection pooler, in front of HAProxy, in turn proxy traffic to Postgres instance behind it.
      The key thing is HAProxy route 2 kind of traffics: write to master only and distribute read to multiple instances.

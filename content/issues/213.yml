      Can you guess that? a map with 2^24 items? Probaly some limit exceed error? Indeed, JS will throw this "Uncaught RangeError: Value undefined out of range for undefined options property undefined"

    description: "Optimistic locking in a strategy that we will allow read, and for write we will assume conflict are unlikely, and if it's conflict we will lock/error out but we push the decision far down the chain.
      One of way is to add a column `lock_version` and when upgrading we attempt to compare the current lock_version if it's different that means the row is updated elsewhere and we will abort it.
      Let's apply that into API design"

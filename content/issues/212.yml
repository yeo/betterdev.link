  Happy monday everyone.

  I hope this week's issue  bring you some joy. We got stories of Rakuten, Clubhouse, Target deploy and debug their system. Infrastructure is hard and take for granted, when it works, no one notices, when it doesn't everyone panic :-).

  Let's learn from team that has build platform to handle massive scale.

    description: |
      When you use the same laptop for different github accounts, thing can easily get messy such as accidently commit to work project as your personal account and vice versa. The way around is to use git config but we have to set them every time we start a new repo? can we magically execute some git config based on the directory we are in? Turn out git support that so we can say for a repo inside a certain directory, then use this git config.

    description: "Any app will need some kind of rate limiting eventually. One of the methods is call Leaky bucket. It is an algorithm that provides a simple, intuitive approach to rate limiting via a queue which you can think of as a bucket holding the requests. Users can burst and fill in the bucket but once it's filled up then subsequent requests are dropped(fall out of bucket)"

    title: "Don’t attach tooltips to document.body"
    description: |
      When attaching tooltips element to the root of body, it takes 80ms to add it to the DOM and the app is blocked in this 80ms. By moving it to an intermediate div element, it only takes 8ms to render and show the tooltip.
      The root cause is because browser has to draw the whole render tree when we add it to the root. When adding to an intermediate element, only that element need to be calculated and redraw.

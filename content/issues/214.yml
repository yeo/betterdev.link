    description: |
       present a simple way of looking at what Git really is and what it really does. I do not claim that this way of looking at Git represents absolute “facts” in any hard and fast or literal sense. But I contend that if you conceive of Git in the way that I’m going to suggest, if you substitute these conceptions of Git for any misconceptions you might have now, you’ll be a much happier and more fluid Git user.

      The concept of event loop, reactor are hard to grasp or explain. We seen so many confusion in NodeJS world.
      libuv is massive to read and understand, this project is based on libev which I found is much smaller and probably easier to undersand.
      If you are internal about the event loop, another cool project(from the same author) is [polyphony](https://github.com/digital-fabric/polyphony) which use io_uring and libev under the hood for concurency in Ruby.

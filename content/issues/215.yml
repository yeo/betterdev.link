      Persistence consists of techniques that adversaries use to keep access to systems across restarts, changed credentials, and other interruptions that could cut off their access.
      In Mac, LaunchDaemons and LaunchAgents are directory for start-up script or daemon process to restore access? But what else, what are other vector attacks?

      In [email world](https://mailwip.com), we had spam trap setup so that no human will email that, and as soon as an email hit that address, we know that the source is sending spam.
      Same in security, An industrious attacker lands on one of your servers and finds a 5MB MySQL dump file (say, called prod_primary.dump). What do they do next?
      Typically, they would load this dump-file into a temporary database to rummage through the data.
      As soon as they do, you get an email/SMS/alert letting you know. Can we made that happen?

    title: "10 Cool SQL Optimisations That do not Depend on the Cost Model"
    description: |
      Cost Based Optimisation is the de-facto standard way to optimise SQL queries in most modern databases.
      For example, if a query may returns > 20% of rows in the table, the query planner might just skip the index and scan the table directly because it may have to read whole table anyway.
      But how about simpler optimisations that can be implemented purely based on meta data (e.g. constraints) and the query itself

    title: "How PCI-Express works and why you should care?"
    description: |
      If you use GPUs, you should know that there are 2 ways to connect them to the motherboard to allow it to connect to the other components (network, CPU, storage device). Solution 1 is through PCI Express and solution 2 through SXM2. We will talk about SXM2 in the future. Today, we will focus on PCI Express. This is because it has a strong dependency with the choice of adjacent hardware such as PCI BUS or CPU.

  Hi everyone, welcome to first issue of November. This week, where I live, red leaves start to emerge and my family went outside, enjoy seeing the beautiful color of autumn. Social media had been a tough week with Twitter and Elon, same as finance system and crypto drama. The world looked so depressing, but no matter what, being a programmer, knowing how to code is really a privilege, we have a way to make a living while sitting at a deck doing thing we enjoy. No matter what happen, there will always a demand to make website, application or service and a continous stream of jobs require to run these things. We are thankful for the jobs and opportunities we had, be optimist and always leaning. on ward. have a good week everyone.

      This week I shared a small tip to debug  CI build failure easiser.
      If you ever debug some tricky CI failure and say to your self: "If I can SSH into this server or container that running the build, I will be able to figure out immediately", then this could be very useful. It can also apply anytime we need to SSH back into some private infrastructure.

    description: |
      Recently, the Chrome developers announced their decision to remove the behind-a-flag support for JPEG XL. Cloudinary argue(to which I agree) JPEG XL can bring these benefits without introducing a regression in other areas, at least in terms of technical strengths. We can only hope that the Chrome developers reverse their decision and help JPEG XL catch up with the old formats in terms of software support, so we can all enjoy the benefits it brings.

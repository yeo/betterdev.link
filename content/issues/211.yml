If you have been dealing with just about anything related to operations on the internet, you know that it's always the DNS in the end, what with its almost 100 different resource records and, uhm, shall we say, \"interesting\" security threat model."

      One of the great arts of software engineering is making updates and improvements to working systems without taking them offline.
      Cloudflare’s network processes more than fourteen million HTTP requests per second at peak for Internet users around the world. The configuration when you update on the UI are pushed to the proxy server on the world in real time.
      They rewrite that configuration system and rolled it out without the world notice anything.

      Javier Anton talked about their app “Collaborative Groups”, which the website2 claims is end-to-end encrypted.

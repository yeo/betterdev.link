    title: "How to win at CORS"
    description: "CORS is complicated because it's a standard implement on client side, by browsers. it's up to browser to do what it wants or needs to implement. CORS also evolved due to the complexity of modern app. The result leads to many outdated documents about CORS. Example, did you know that when using `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` then you cannot pass cookie? but it's up to client to implement that protection. Or if we pass cookie, `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` has to be existed in preflight. And when and why browser made preflight requests. Great, it's getting complicated ;-)"

    description: |
      Microsoft delivers the latest Windows security and user experiences updates monthly. Updates are modular meaning that, regardless of which update you currently have installed, you only need the most recent quality update to get your machine up to date.
      With the fast pace of Windows security and quality fixes, distributing this large amount of updated content takes up substantial bandwidth. Reducing this network transfer is critical for a great experience. Moreover, users on slower networks can struggle to keep their machines up to date with the latest security fixes if they cannot download the package.

    description: |
      Most databases involve heavy sorting operations before the data is analyzed, visualized, and presented to end-users. Often, depending on the complexity of the query and the volume of data to be sorted, it not only turns out to be highly expensive operation, but capable enough to bring chaos in a production environment. It‚Äôs critical not just to tune resources required for sorting, but also do so sensibly, so you can achieve the desired result by sorting fewer rows from a table instead of having to scan the whole table.

      Writing CSS has probably never been more fun and exciting than it is today. In this post we‚Äôll take a look at common problems and use cases we all have to face in our work and how to solve them with modern CSS.
      I particularly like the [Form Field Focus without outlines](https://lab.hakim.se/focussss/) and going to  implement it for all of my username/password form in the future.

    title: "How not to blow up the production database"
    description: |
      When running a production database, one needs to carefully consider all the data access patterns. The usual trap people fall into is optimizing for one data access pattern at the cost of all others. This causes production systems to fail spectacularly or lose millions of dollar as the system becomes slower over time.
      The team at battlefy presents us how they evolve from reduce write, calculation on read, cache to using materialized views.

      Have ever write a shell script and want a real window UI to input data? Hook up to sixtyfps. Basically from your shell script, you call sixtyfps, pass a UI DSL into stdin and sixtyfps render the UI. User enter data, click "OK", and sixtyfps quite, and write back output to stdout where your shell script can access and parse it. Very useful. Read [introduction post](https://sixtyfps.io/blog/showing-guis-from-shell-scripts.html)

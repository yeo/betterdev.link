  Hi all,

  We come back to my second week :). If you like BetterDev, please help spead word out by refer to your friends. [Buy Me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/betterdev) would be great too

  In previous email, I said about a new self hosted section. Due to a bug the sefl hosted doesn't appear in email, you can go back to re-read the previous issue for awesome tool that you can run on your own hardware.

  Onward to our news issue today.

  First thing, there is a [suppy chain attack on xz](https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/29/4), it has assigned [CVE-2024-3094](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-3094), If you had install xz 5.6.x, that version is affected. If it's a server, better to destroy and rebuild a new server with xz 5.4.

  If you're using mac,  you can check which xz version you had installed

  ```
  brew info xz
  ```

  If it return 5.6, perform an `brew upgrade xz` and it will rollback to 5.4.

  Continue on this story, no one know the real identity of the attacker so far. He has spend 2 years contribute code in a legitimate way. 2 years of works. Had he implement the backdoor correctly and not causing slowness, probably no one has notice. Someone [shared a similar story on mastodon](https://rigor-mortis.nmrc.org/@simplenomad/112184869681420177).

  Another dance in open source community is the Redis license change, rest assured that if you're just using Redis as an end-user theree is nothign change, you will be continue to use it. On top of that, Linux foundation has already launch [Valkey](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey) , which is a fork of Redis right before the license change. In Redis codebase, top [changeset contributions by employe](https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/966631/6bf2063136effa1e/) is Tencent, not even Redis Lab. Alibaba comes in third place, then Huawei. So I think there will be definetely a path to the official Redis, similar to the IO.js story back  in the old day, where everyone switch to the community fork. So no action require as an end-user, in the meantime, exploring the new ValKey project.

  title: "Running a Raspberry Pi with a read-only root filesystem"
  description: |
    Many applications that run on Raspberry Pis and similar single-board computers — for example, environmental data loggers that report to a central database server — don’t really need to store any state locally on the Pi’s SD card. This means you can run the Pi with a read-only root filesystem, which will dramatically increase the SD card’s lifetime.

  description: |
    Pretty much any home computers are behind a NAT, mean multiple computer share a same public ip. In the TCP/UDP packet, there is a port, the pair ip:port can be used to track which host and send the packet back. But ping operate with ICMP, and ICMP packet doesnt have a port field. So how does NAT work for ICMP packets?

    Anytime you start to implement HIPAA, SOC, NIST PCE-DSS, the file integrity monitoring come up? who changed this file? when? what is changed?
    In this articule, we look into that with [Tetragon](https://github.com/cilium/tetragon).
    Not just for security, say you have a config file, such as an env file that is source before application run, tracking changes to this file can help spot and solve problem in an outage too.

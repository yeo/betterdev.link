      a paper on an open-source fully automatic large-scale SSO landscape, security, and privacy analysis tool.
      They automatically identified 1,632 websites with 3,020 Apple, Facebook, or Google logins within the Tranco 10k and analyse them. Some fact such as 10% of SSO is failed because of mis-configuring redirect_uris.
      The paper is also a remind for us to cleanup stuff and make sure our SSO, especially for internal tooling/documents is up to date with the right config.

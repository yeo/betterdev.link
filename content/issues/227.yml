    title: "How to avoid layout shifts caused by web fonts"
    description: |
      Fonts cause layout shifts when the size of the containing element (e.g. a <div> or paragraph) changes when the web font is downloaded.
      This occurs when the height of the font or the length of the paragraph is different with the web font compared to the system font.

    title: "Scaling Kubernetes to Over 4k Nodes and 200k Pods"
    description: |
      Unlike Apache Mesos, which can scale up to 10,000 nodes out of the box, scaling Kubernetes is challenging. Kubernetes‚Äô scalability is not just limited to the number of nodes and pods, but several aspects like the number of resources created, the number of containers per pod, the total number of services, and the pod deployment throughput. This post describes some challenges we faced when scaling and how we solved them.

    description: |
      Postgres Advisory Locks are a great solution for arbitrary application locks, particularly in scenarios where you are already using Postgres and have a need to block concurrent mutations to a resource (that resource DOES NOT have to be data in Postgres)

    description: |
      Signup forms with specific and archaic password rules can be incredibly frustrating for anyone using a password manager. "Must have one special character, but only from !@#$ these allowed characters."
      When building PlanetScale‚Äôs signup form, we wanted to enforce strong passwords while also working well with password managers. After researching the problem, we found the best method for doing this is using an entropy-based password strength calculation.

    description: "transform a full-colour image into one made up entirely of different shades of grey. The sort of image that we will create is called greyscale, because every colour that makes up the image is stored as a position on a predetermined scale of greys that starts at black and ends at white. Code in Go but it's fun and easy to port to anything else"

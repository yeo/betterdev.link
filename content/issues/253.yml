  Hi everyone,

  I've returned this week and hope to make this newsletter a more regular occurrence. I apologize if my absence and lack of updates have disappointed any of you.

  Since we last caught up, I've made several updates. I've polished my side project, [ec2.shop](https://ec2.shop), which I believe is the best tool for quickly viewing all on-demand, spot, and reserve prices on a single page. Give it a try and let me know what you think.

  One significant change in my perspective since last year is my strong belief in the importance of self-hosting more nowadays, rather than relying on free tiers or cloud providers.
 
  I've witnessed cases where individuals have lost years of photos after being locked out of their Google accounts, with no means of contacting a real person to resolve the issue. Moving forward, I'll be adding a self-hosted section so we can started to move into the direction of owning our own content.

  It's also the reason my newsletter platform is home-grown, self-made.

  Since it's been a while since I last sent out this newsletter, if you find it's no longer to your liking, you can click unsubscribe at the bottom of this email.

      As a software engineer, I like to tinker around hardware projects, physical thing that you can touch, and show to our faimily.
      Radio is fastinating because there are many valueable information being pass around. You can listen to airplane communication, track aircraft via ADS-B, you will write some code
      to decode the signal and make sense of them. You can even throw a front-end to render them on a map for example.

      Given a color image? How can we convert it to black and white, pixel-art-like images? The cool thing about these pixel-art image is they can be easily embed into a README.md and render great.
      We will learn the binning algorithm, implement purely just with JavaScript.

    title: "The Day Soft Deletes Caused Chaos"
    description: |
      Soft delete is the practice of not deleting the row physically but create a flag that we delete a row. It's very simple to implement because deleting data isn't easy. Such as deleting a user lead to remove many relevant data, relevant foreign key. Data can also refer to external data, such as user avatar store on S3. because of that, many use soft delete. it does add complexity for operation though, and what can go wrong, we will learn today.

    description: |
      [The One Billion Row Challenge](https://www.morling.dev/blog/one-billion-row-challenge/) is to write a Java program for retrieving temperature measurement values from a text file and calculating the min, mean, and max temperature per weather station. There’s just one caveat: the file has 1,000,000,000 rows! It has been expand and adopt by many languages or eco system. This one show an optimization to bring up almost 20x performance. There one another similar challenge of [moving a billion postgres rows on 100 budget](https://blog.peerdb.io/moving-a-billion-postgres-rows-on-a-100-budget)

      There are already tool to help write Postgres extension with Rust such as [pgrx](https://kaiwern.com/posts/2022/07/20/writing-postgresql-extension-in-rust-with-pgx/). Now we can do with Zig. After the last 2 years working with Rust,
      I feel like it's such as great language that is truely innovative compare with other, but there is still room for a low level language that isn't too strict such as Zig.
      Using zig to write a postgess extension feel great.

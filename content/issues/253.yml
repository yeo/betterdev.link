  Hi everyone,

  I had come back this week and hope to return this newsletter more frequently. I'm so sorry if I have been letting anyone down without any updates. 

  I had quite a few update from last when I was started. I had polish my side project [ec2.shop](ec2.shop), it's the best tool to quickly get a view all of on-demand, spot and reverse price all in the same page. Give it a try and let me know.

  One thing has changed in my point of view since last year is I strongly belive we should self-hosted more nowsaday instead of relying on the free tier or cloud provider.

  I had seen cases of people losing their year of photos when the google account get locked out, without any way to contract a real human being to resolve the issue. So moving forward, I'm adding a self-hosted section now to address these.

  Because it has been a while I haven't send out this newsletter, if you no longer enjoy, you can click unsubscribe at the bottom of this email.

      As a software engineer, I like to tinker around hardware projects, physical thing that you can touch, and show to our faimily.
      Radio is fastinating because there are many valueable information being pass around. You can listen to airplane communication, track aircraft via ADS-B, you will write some code
      to decode the signal and make sense of them. You can even throw a front-end to render them on a map for example.

      We will learn the binning algorithm, implement purely just with JavaScript.

    description: |
      Soft delete is the practice of not deleting the row physically but create a flag that we delete a row. It's very simple to implement because deleting data isn't easy. Such as deleting a user lead to remove many relevant data, relevant foreign key. Data can also refer to external data, such as user avatar store on S3. because of that, many use soft delete. it does add complexity for operation though, and what can go wrong, we will learn today.

    description: |
      [The One Billion Row Challenge](https://www.morling.dev/blog/one-billion-row-challenge/) is to write a Java program for retrieving temperature measurement values from a text file and calculating the min, mean, and max temperature per weather station. There’s just one caveat: the file has 1,000,000,000 rows! It has been expand and adopt by many languages or eco system. This one show an optimization to bring up almost 20x performance. There one another similar challenge of [moving a billion postgres rows on 100 budget](https://blog.peerdb.io/moving-a-billion-postgres-rows-on-a-100-budget)

      There are already tool to help write Postgres extension with Rust such as [pgrx](https://kaiwern.com/posts/2022/07/20/writing-postgresql-extension-in-rust-with-pgx/). Now we can do with Zig. After the last 2 years working with Rust,
      I feel like it's such as great language that is truely innovative compare with other, but there is still room for a low level language that isn't too strict such as Zig.
      Using zig to write a postgess extension feel great.

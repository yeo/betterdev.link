    title: "Cryptographic Best Practices"
    description: |
      Putting cryptographic primitives together is a lot like putting a jigsaw puzzle together, where all the pieces are cut exactly the same way, but there is only one correct solution. Thankfully, there are some projects out there that are working hard to make sure developers are getting it right.

    description: |
      In this post we're going to focus on the ways that a single load balancer might distribute HTTP requests to a set of servers. We'll start from the bottom and work our way up to modern load balancing algorithms.

    title: "Systems design 2: What we hope we know"
    description: "Someone asked if I could write about the rise of AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) and what I think that means for the future of people, technology, society, and so on. Although that's a fun topic, it left me with two problems: I know approximately nothing about AI, and predicting the future is hard even for people who know what they're talking about. Instead, I'll tell you a bunch of things I do know that are somehow related to the topic, and then you can predict the future yourself."

    description: |
      Slack is a very complicated system with complicated rule. Mute channel, when to send notification, where(email or device), did user see this notification in email already? Debugging notification is complicated at Slack scale, so they build a system to trace the notification across the system.

    title: "Improving Fault Tolerance with RPC Fallbacks in DoorDash‚Äôs Microservices"
    description: |
      Challenge of Microservice is they call each others, one client request turns into many internal RPC call, and amplify the failure rate when making these requests due to nature of network. Retrying is often use, but if the service is completeley failed, how can we skip it immediately. This is DoorDash strategy for that

    description: |
      help beginners understand and set up server replication in PostgreSQL using failover and failback. Postgres evolve fast and process to setup Postgres replication is way simpler than in Postgres 10 or 12 for example.

    description: |
      Storing time ranges in a database is easy, but you must also prevent overlapping rows for some applications. Accomplishing this requirement can be challenging because of race conditions.

    description: |
      One of a neat way to extend Postgres is define your own function using SQL.
      But needless to say SQL has its limit, so there are  PL/Python where you can define function with Python code.
      Now that go futher, you can define function in Rust, which compile to native machine code, not interprer through Postgres engine, so you will get great performance

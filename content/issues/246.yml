      We don't usually list product announcement but I think this is worth to mention.
      We all know and love ChatGPT from OpenAI. Since then, Meta released LlaMA together with the weight.
      Stanford built the Alpaca model, which was based on LLaMA, but tuned on a small dataset of 50,000 human-like questions and answers that, surprisingly, made it exhibit ChatGPT-like interactivity.
      Databricks’ show that, dolly-v1-6b, a large language model (blog post) trained on the Databricks machine learning platform, demonstrates that a two-years-old open source model can do.
      It's good experiment to play around with these models.

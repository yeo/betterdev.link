  This week I come across a tool call [LocalAI](https://github.com/go-skynet/LocalAI). I always curious how to replicate OpenAI, have them run locally and this [LocalAI](https://github.com/go-skynet/LocalAI) is the answer, bill itself as free, Open Source OpenAI alternative. Self-hosted, community-driven and local-first. Drop-in replacement for OpenAI running on consumer-grade hardware. No GPU required. Runs ggml, gguf, GPTQ, onnx, TF compatible models: llama, llama2, rwkv, whisper, vicuna, koala, cerebras, falcon, dolly, starcoder. It defs live up to its hype with 12k+ stars on Github.

Servers only send a few packets (typically 10) in the initial round-trip while TCP is warming up (referred to as TCP slow start). After sending the first set of packets, it needs to wait for the client to acknowledge it received all those packets.

      In this guide we're going to take a look at how we can use cheap and "low end" hardware to build an amazing OpenBSD router with firewalling capabilities, segmented local area networks, DNS with domain blocking, DHCP and more.
      Even if you aren't plan to use OpenBSD, it is still useful because almost all components are 100% compatible with Linux such as unbound, or iptable instead of pf.

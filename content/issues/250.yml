  Hi everyone, This week, many resorts in Las Vegas got hack and have to shutdown their system. That means many operation is handled by paper and pen. The hack appears to be executed by [BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware group](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/personal/2023/09/ransomware-group-steps-up-issues-statement-over-mgm-resorts-compromise) and you can read about [their statement and analysis here](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/personal/2023/09/ransomware-group-steps-up-issues-statement-over-mgm-resorts-compromise). A reminder for all of us to be more caution with social engineering hacks.

      Sometimes our Internet connection seems weird, and we don’t understand why. We know something is wrong, but we cannot really pinpoint the issue. And other times, there is weird file access that goes undetected simply because we don’t know what to look for. Logs won't be helpful in those case because they might be logged. Lets' look at the tool that help us identity and analyze network traffic.

      While I'm a big fan of Postgres, I have used MongoDB extensively too and their replicaset is amazing. All the failover and done automatically, with built-in client auto-retry and auto discover help the whole setup. With Postgres, we still have a lot of work to do to get there, but thing are improving in Postgres 16.

  Hi everyone, this week is security week.

  First, if you used CircleCI, make sure to rotate any secret since they [suffered a breach](https://circleci.com/blog/january-4-2023-security-alert/).
  Second, Slack private repository got hacked too, and there is no customer data there but regardless, if your company use Slack, best to be rotate as well.
  Third, Pytorch got a [supply chain attack and compromise too](https://pytorch.org/blog/compromised-nightly-dependency/), luckily only for nightly build, so if you don't use nightly build, you're fine"

      The project started as POC and turn into a success, so they live with data in local files until traffic spike 10x and data is added at the 10x rate too"

    title: "Easy, alternative soft deletion: `deleted_record_insert`"
    description: |
      Soft delete is a technique where instead of removing data, we flag it as deleted by using a column like "deleted: true" or "deleted_at: time". It seemed smart, cool, and very convenience since the data is there to refer back.
      However, it is easy to lead to mistake and complex our query. Every query has to check for it, index need to be built around, whoever join data need to check for it and so on.
      It adds up quickly and everytime I used it, I regret in the end,  and just delete data for real.
      Here is another middle approach: use a completely new table with jsonb to store the whole record.

      Reddit UI is very slow to load, constantly nagge us to use mobile app.
      Luckily they have a very openapi and people build UI on top of it. librreddit is built on rust, focus on content and run very fast.
      Part of my routine is source content from Reddit and IO found libreddit is a much easiser way to navigate reddit nowadays.

      This probably should be in "Read code" but I think it could be a very valuable tools to design SSH-based tool.
      One of my use case is I have a very expensive build server which maynot being used often, let them run around is costly, so I setup a smaller node, and forward TCP traffic to the bigger node. When there is no connection, it shutdown the expensive node, and when the first request come in, it boot up the expensive server.

      This is the kind of guide I wish I know earlier. It's very practical on how you can run that kind of network yourself, from registering ASN, acquire IP address, find BGP hosting...
    It can cost zero if you use IPV6 :). That's the cool thing that you can literally experiment with this kind of tech at very low cost"

    description: |
      Postgres Advisory Locks are a great solution for arbitrary application locks, particularly in scenarios where you are already using Postgres and have a need to block concurrent mutations to a resource (that resource DOES NOT have to be data in Postgres).

      An optimization story, which is interesting because both the before and after query plans will look somewhat ridiculous (in terms of cost). Moreover, it shows how PostgreSQL row count estimation can go very wrong. In this case, domain knowledge will help us trick PostgreSQL into a different query plan which will be waaay faster, without adding any additional indices.

      This post is a deep dive into how the UK Coronavirus analytics dashboard came to be, and why it’s architected the way it’s architected. In this post you’ll learn about the database challenges the team faced as the dashboard needed to scale—with an eye toward how the UKHSA team uses Azure, the Azure Database for PostgreSQL managed service, and the Citus extension which transforms Postgres into a distributed database.

      PostgreSQL query planner is full of surprises, so a common-sense approach to writing performant queries is sometimes misleading. In this blog post, I’ll describe examples of optimizing seemingly obvious queries with the help of EXPLAIN ANALYZE and Postgres metadata analysis.

      Non-constant time crypto code is dangerous. Exactly 20 years ago Kocher presented the first timing attack on a cryptographic implementation. Since then, a long list of implementations have been broken by timing attacks.

  A very practical issue. Dealing with authorization, SSH agent, design API, optimize big JS bundle, text vs varchar in database design. I hope you like these as much as I do.

  Have a great week everyone.

      There's a fundamental tension in authorization. Is it business logic or authorization logic? Should it be in the app, or separate?
      Authorization wasn't particularly fashionable in tech circles. Fast-forward to today, and Airbnb, Carta, Slack, and Intuit are all writing blog posts about the internal authorization systems they built. Suddenly it seems like authorization is a topic as cool as moving to Kubernetes!

      rogramming hasn’t fundamentally changed in a long time. Building an app usually means Googling for the right component library, debugging dependencies, rewriting a lot of boilerplate code, and figuring out where to deploy. Everything but solving the problem at hand.
      Retool is a new approach: we’ve unified the ease of visual programming with the power and flexibility of real code. Connect to any database or API. Drag-and-drop a UI while simultaneously live programming it. Deploy instantly.
      Allbirds uses Retool to measure billboard efficacy. Amazon uses Retool to handle GDPR requests. You, too, can use it to build business-critical applications fast.

      Using ssh-agent, your key can be transfered securely to a jumpbox and from that jump box you an login to another server using that key. But it has so many pitfall to the point many suggest to never use it. In this posts, we will see how we can leverage it safely. Because while proxyjump is useful for SSH, it's won't superuseful for thing like `git clone`.

      Nextflix heavily uses gRPC for the purpose of backend to backend communication.
      When processing a request it is often beneficial to know which fields the caller is interested in and which ones they ignore.
      How can they understand which fields the caller doesn’t need to be supplied in the response in a gRPC request?

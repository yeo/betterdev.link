      Instead of just using OpenAI and consume, we can look into how to run and play with a real LLM on your own computer. That will help us learn much faster, especially if we're dipping our toe into AI/ML. Also checkout the petals tool at the tool section in this  issue.

    description: |
      This article focuses on improving the modeling performance of LLMs by finetuning them using carefully curated datasets. Specifically, this article highlights strategies that involve modifying, utilizing, or manipulating the datasets for instruction-based finetuning rather than altering the model architecture or training algorithms. This article will also explain how you can prepare your own datasets to finetune open-source LLMs.

      Python has a super cool feature where you add `@name` on top of a function and name is call, wrap your function inside. Now we can do similar to that in Ruby, implement entirely as a library at Ruby level. no new keyword, just pure Ruby syntax.

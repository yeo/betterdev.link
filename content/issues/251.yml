  description: |
    Disk IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second) is a key metric for measuring the performance of any disk system. It represents the number of read and write operations that can be performed per second. For PostgreSQL, which relies heavily on disk access, understanding and optimizing disk IOPS is crucial for achieving optimal performance.

    Dolap accidently remove their comment service infra. They click delete on "Cloudformation" stack, which is a process that cannot be cancel. Panic. The key thing help them is "deletion protection" on RDS. While normal stateless component will be removed, the core place where data remains is safe. So do yourself a favor and enable "deletion protection" on all of your stateful resource today.

  description: |
    AWS RDS has a physical storage size limit of 128TiB for each RDS cluster. Postman has a db of 95TB and growing at 2TB per month. So they plan to prune the old data. However, just drop a table won't reclaim the space. They needs to rebuild the table, but it's a costly process. This is real world engineering, read to see how they become creative and overcome the challenge.

    How software fails is interesting. But real-world errors can be infrequent to manifest. Fault injection is a formal-sounding term that just means: trying to explicitly trigger errors in the hopes of discovering bad logic, typically during automated tests.
